/* Enumerates the voxels on the specified ray up to the specified maximum depth. Calls the block for each voxel cell.
 * The block may set '*stop=YES;' to indicate that enumeration should terminate with a successful condition. The block
 * may set '*fail=YES;' to indicate that enumeration should terminate with a non-successful condition. Typically, this
 * occurs when the block realizes that it must block to take a lock.
 * Returns YES or NO depending on whether the operation was successful. This method will do its best to avoid blocking
 * (i.e. by waiting to take locks) and will return early if the alternative is to block. In this case, the function
 * returns NO.
