Gutsy Storm is the codename for an otherwise nameless game project which
is basically me having fun with blocky/voxel, procedurally generated terrain
similar to Minecraft. This is not intended to be a Minecraft clone. Instead,
the plan is to use Minecraft-like terrain and terrain editing functionality for
an Action-RPG style game. So, this will eventually be a bit of a Diablo clone
with a Minecraft-style voxel world.

GutsyStormCocoa is my effort to restart the Gutsy Storm project with the game
written in Cocoa/Objective-C from the ground up. This was done in responsive
to the truly horrendous performance I was getting out of Python even after
investing a considerable amount of effort toward performance optimizations.

System Requirements for Using Gutsy Storm
=========================================
The game has been tested on two machines:
 * MacBookPro5,1
 * iMac??,? (yeah, I'll have to look up the model string)

The game uses a large amount of memory and this could impair performance on your
machine.

In normal circumstances, there is a working set of voxel and geometry data
which must be held in memory at all times and a set of data which is held purely
for caching. The cache will be expanded and contracted automatically based on
the amount of memory available on the system. So, the working set is the real
concern here, especially if it is too large to hold in memory on your machine.

If the frame rate is very low, try lowering the size of the "active region"
by entering the following in Terminal:

    % defaults write com.foxostro.GutsyStorm ActiveRegionExtent -int 128

You may also want to this with a value of "64" or "192". (The default is 256.)

Also, the active region size controls the draw distance of the terrain, so
reducing this value can improve performance by reducing load to the GPU.


Getting Started
===============
To build the game, just open it in Xcode and run! There is no bootstrap step.
