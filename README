Gutsy Storm is the codename for an otherwise nameless game project which
is basically me having fun with blocky/voxel, procedurally generated terrain
similar to Minecraft. This is not intended to be a Minecraft clone. Instead,
the plan is to use Minecraft-like terrain and terrain editing functionality for
an Action-RPG style game. So, this will eventually be a bit of a Diablo clone
with a Minecraft-style voxel world.

GutsyStormCocoa is my effort to restart the Gutsy Storm project with the game
written in Cocoa/Objective-C from the ground up. This was done in responsive
to the truly horrendous performance I was getting out of Python even after
investing a considerable amount of effort toward performance optimizations.
